# rpi3-bluetooth

:warning: **This project is not necessary. Starting from resinOS 2.9.3+rev1, bluetooth devices are controlled by the host operating system and available for all
user containers. Just install the software tools that you require to talk to the bluetooth devices, and start using it.** :warning:

**The below notes are kept for reference.**

Raspberry Pi 3 on-board Bluetooth example

This project enables bluetooth and demonstrates some simple commands to interact with a bluetooth device.

To get this project up and running, you will need to signup for a [resin.io](https://resin.io/) account [here](https://dashboard.resin.io/signup) and set up a Raspberry Pi 3, have a look at our [Getting Started Tutorial](http://docs.resin.io/raspberrypi/nodejs/getting-started/) if you haven't already. Once you are set up with resin.io, you will need to clone this repo locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/resin-io-projects/rpi3-bluetooth.git
```
Then add your resin.io application's remote repository to your local repository:

```
$ git remote add resin username@git.resin.io:username/myapp.git
```
and push the code to the newly added remote:

```
$ git push resin master
```
It should take a few minutes for the code to push. Once the code has pushed the `scan.sh` script will enable the on-board Bluetooth, you should see this in your logs:

To test everything works you will need to run some simple commands to scan for devices, connect to a device, discover characteristics and write to a characteristic.

Scan for devices:
```
$ hcitool lescan
LE Scan ...
18:B4:30:51:4C:E5 (unknown)
66:53:B2:89:24:D3 (unknown)
66:53:B2:89:24:D3 (unknown)
EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF resin
EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF (unknown)
18:B4:30:51:4C:E5 Nest Cam
```
the output shows 6 devices found, we are going to connect to the `EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF resin` device:
```
$ gatttool -b EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF -t random -I
[EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF][LE]>
```
at the prompt enter `connect` to connect to the device:
```
[EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF][LE]>connect
Attempting to connect to EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF
Connection successful
[EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF][LE]>
```
at the prompt enter `char-desc` to discover characteristics advertised by the device:
```
[EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF][LE]> char-desc
handle: 0x0001, uuid: 00002800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
handle: 0x0002, uuid: 00002803-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
handle: 0x0003, uuid: 00002a00-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
handle: 0x0004, uuid: 00002803-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
```
the output shows 4 characteristics found, we are going to write to the characteristic at `handle: 0x0004, uuid: 00002803-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`. At the prompt enter `char-write-req 04 01` to write a `1` to the characteristic:
```
[EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF][LE]> char-write-req 04 01
Characteristic value was written successfully
```
finally we need to close the connection, enter `disconnect` at the prompt:
```
[EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF][LE]> disconnect
[EE:50:F0:F8:3C:FF][LE]>
```
followed by `Ctrl + D` to exit gatttool.
